NVM Express [®] NVM Command Set Specification, Revision 1.2


**2 NVM Command Set Model**


The NVM Express Base Specification defines a property level interface for a host to communicate with a
non-volatile memory subsystem (NVM subsystem). This specification defines additional functionality for the
NVM Command Set.


**2.1** **Theory of operation**


An NVM subsystem is comprised of some number of controllers, where each controller may access some
number of namespaces. For the NVM Command Set, each namespace is comprised of logical blocks. A
logical block is the smallest unit of data that may be read or written from the controller. The logical block
data size, reported in bytes, is always a power of two. Logical block data sizes may be 512 bytes, 1 KiB,
2 KiB, 4 KiB, 8 KiB, etc. NVM Command Set commands are used to access and modify logical block
contents within a namespace.


**Namespaces**


A namespace is set of resources that may be accessed by a host and is as defined in the NVM Express
Base Specification. A namespace has an associated namespace identifier that a host uses to access that
namespace.


The Identify Namespace data structure (refer to Figure 114), for a namespace associated with this
command set, contains related fields reporting the namespace size, namespace capacity, and namespace
utilization:

  - The Namespace Size (NSZE) field defines the total size of the namespace in logical blocks (LBA 0
through LBA n-1).

  - The Namespace Capacity (NCAP) field defines the maximum number of logical blocks that may be
allocated at any point in time.

  - The Namespace Utilization (NUSE) field defines the number of logical blocks currently allocated in
the namespace.


The following relationship holds: Namespace Size >= Namespace Capacity >= Namespace Utilization.


If the THINP bit is set to ‘1’ in the NSFEAT field of the Identify Namespace data structure, the controller:

  - may report a value in the Namespace Capacity field that is less than the value in the Namespace
Size field; and

  - shall track the number of allocated blocks in the Namespace Utilization field.


If the THINP bit is cleared to ‘0’, the controller:

  - shall report a value in the Namespace Capacity field that is equal to the value of Namespace Size
field; and

  - may report a value in the Namespace Utilization field that is always equal to the value in the
Namespace Capacity field.


A logical block shall be marked as allocated when that logical block is written with:

  - a User Data Out Command (refer to section 1.4.2.10);

  - a Write Uncorrectable command (refer to section 3.3.7); or

  - a Write Zeroes command (refer to section 3.3.8) that does not deallocate the logical block.


A logical block may be marked as allocated as the result of:

  - a User Data Out Command not addressing the logical block (e.g., NPWG field may indicate
sequential logical blocks placed and tracked together on the media (refer to section 5.2.2.1));

  - a Write Zeroes command (refer to section 3.3.8) not addressing the logical block;


12


NVM Express [®] NVM Command Set Specification, Revision 1.2


  - a sanitize operation (refer to section 5.10); or.

  - a Format NVM command (refer to section 4.1.2).


Commands and operations that may result in a logical block being deallocated include:

  - a Dataset Management command (refer to section 3.3.3);

  - a Write Zeroes command (refer to section 3.3.8) addressing the logical block;

  - a sanitize operation (refer to section 5.10); or.

  - a Format NVM command (refer to section 4.1.2).


Vendor specific means are able to allocate or deallocate logical blocks.


If the controller supports Asymmetric Namespace Access Reporting (i.e., the Asymmetric Namespace
Access Reporting Support (ANARS) bit is set to ‘1’ in the CMIC field in the Identify Controller data structure
(refer to the NVM Express Base Specification)), then the NUSE field (refer to Figure 114) and the NVMCAP
field (refer to Figure 114) are cleared to 0h if the relationship between the controller and the namespace is
in the ANA Inaccessible state or the ANA Persistent Loss state (refer to the Asymmetric Namespace Access
Reporting section in the NVM Express Base Specification). The Attached Namespace Attribute Changed
asynchronous event and the Allocated Namespace Attribute Changed asynchronous event are not
generated for changes to these fields that result from ANA state changes as described in the Asynchronous
Event Request command section in the NVM Express Base Specification. The host uses the Asymmetric
Namespace Access Change Notices as an indication of these changes.


**Command Ordering Requirements**


For all commands which are not part of a fused operation (refer to section 2.1.3), or for which the write size
is greater than value indicated by the AWUN field (refer to section 2.1.4.2), each command is processed
as an independent entity without reference to other commands submitted to the same I/O Submission
Queue or to commands submitted to other I/O Submission Queues. Specifically, the controller is not
responsible for checking the LBA of a User Data In or User Data Out command to ensure any type of
ordering between commands. For example, if a Read command is submitted for LBA _x_ and there is a Write
command also submitted for LBA _x_, there is no guarantee of the order of completion for those commands
(the Read command may finish first or the Write command may finish first). If there are ordering
requirements between these commands, a host (e.g., host software or the associated application) is
required to enforce that ordering above the level of the controller.


**Fused Operation**


Fused operations are defined in the NVM Express Base Specification. The NVM Command Set adds the
following requirements for Fused operations. The command sequences that may be used in a fused
operation for the NVM Command Set are defined in Figure 3.


**Figure 3: Supported Fused Operations**

|Command 1|Command 2|Fused Operation|
|---|---|---|
|Compare|Write|Compare and Write|



**2.1.3.1** **Compare and Write**


The Compare and Write fused operation compares the contents of the logical block(s) specified in the
Compare command to the data stored at the indicated LBA range. If the compare operation is successful,
then the LBA range is updated with the data provided in the Write command. If the compare operation is
not successful, then the controller shall abort the Write command with a status code of Command Aborted


13


NVM Express [®] NVM Command Set Specification, Revision 1.2


due to Failed Fused Command and the contents in the LBA range are not modified. If the write operation
is not successful, the Compare command completion status is unaffected.


The LBA range, if used, shall be the same for the two commands. If the LBA ranges do not match, then the
controller should abort the commands with a status code of Invalid Field in Command.


**Note:** To ensure the Compare and Write is an atomic operation in a multi-host environment, the host should
ensure that the size of a Compare and Write fused operation is no larger than the ACWU/NACWU (refer to
section 2.1.4) and that Atomic Boundaries are respected (refer to section 2.1.4.4). Controllers may abort a
Compare and Write fused operation that is larger than ACWU/NACWU or that crosses an Atomic Boundary
with a status code of Atomic Write Unit Exceeded.


**Atomic Operation**


A controller is in either Single Atomicity Mode (refer to section 2.1.4.1) or Multiple Atomicity Mode (refer to
section 2.1.4.5) for each attached namespace. In Single Atomicity Mode, controller processing of a write
command results in at most one atomic write operation, and controller processing of a write command that
crosses any Namespace Atomic Boundary (refer to section 2.1.4.4) may or may not result in an atomic
write operation. In Multiple Atomicity Mode, controller processing of a write command that crosses any
Namespace Atomic Boundary (e.g., a write command that has a size greater than the AWUN/NAWUN
value) results in multiple atomic write operations.


Multiple Atomicity Mode is a superset of Single Atomicity Mode. A host that is not aware of Multiple Atomicity
Mode (i.e., is operating under the assumption that write commands are processed in Single Atomicity Mode)
does not encounter unexpected or incompatible behavior.


**2.1.4.1** **Atomic Operation in Single Atomicity Mode**


In Single Atomicity Mode, controller processing of a write command results in at most one atomic write
operation. Figure 4 is an overview of the parameters that define the controller’s support for Single Atomicity
Mode atomic write operation. These parameters may affect command behavior and execution order based
on write size (on a per controller or a per namespace basis).

NVM Express [®] NVM Command Set Specification, Revision 1.2


The NVM subsystem reports in the Identify Controller data structure the size in logical blocks of the write
operation guaranteed to be written atomically under various conditions, including:


  - normal operation;

  - power fail;

  - the write portion of a Compare and Write fused operation (refer to section 2.1.3.1); and

  - the write portion of a Copy command (refer to section 3.3.2).


The values reported in the Identify Controller data structure are valid across all namespaces with any
supported namespace format, forming a baseline value that is guaranteed not to change.


An NVM subsystem may report per namespace values for these atomicity parameters that are specific to
the namespace and are indicated in the Identify Namespace data structure (refer to Figure 114). If an NVM
subsystem reports a per namespace value, then that value shall be greater than or equal to the
corresponding baseline value indicated in the Identify Controller data structure (refer to Figure 117).


The values are reported in the fields (Namespace) Atomic Write Unit Normal, (Namespace) Atomic Write
Unit Power Fail, and (Namespace) Atomic Compare & Write Unit in the Identify Controller data structure or
the Identify Namespace data structure depending on whether the values are the baseline or namespace
specific.


A controller may support Atomic Boundaries that shall not be crossed by an atomic write operation. The
Namespace Atomic Boundary Parameters (i.e., the NABSN, NABO, and NABSPF fields) define these
boundaries for a namespace. A namespace supports Atomic Boundaries if NABSN field or NABSPF field
is set to a non-zero value. For a namespace that does not support Atomic Boundaries, the controller shall
clear the NABSN and NABSPF fields to 0h. Namespace Atomicity Parameter and Namespace Atomic
Boundary Parameter values may be format specific and may change if the namespace format is modified.


In the case of a shared namespace (e.g., a dispersed namespace or shared namespace that is not a
dispersed namespace), operations performed by an individual controller are atomic to the shared
namespace at the write atomicity level reported in the corresponding Identify Controller or Identify
Namespace data structures of the controller to which the command was submitted.


**2.1.4.2** **AWUN/NAWUN**


AWUN/NAWUN control the atomicity of command execution in relation to other commands. They impose
inter-command serialization of writing of blocks of data to the NVM and prevent blocks of data ending up
on the NVM containing partial data from one new command and partial data from one or more other new
commands.


If a write command is submitted that has a size less than or equal to the AWUN/NAWUN value and the
write command does not cross an atomic boundary (refer to section 2.1.4.4), then the host is guaranteed
that the write command is atomic to the NVM with respect to other read or write commands. If a write
command is submitted that has a size greater than the AWUN/NAWUN value or crosses an atomic
boundary, then:


  - In Single Atomicity Mode (refer to section 2.1.4.1), there is no guarantee of command atomicity;
and

  - In Multiple Atomicity Mode (refer to section 2.1.4.5), atomicity is guaranteed for each portion of the
command that falls within an atomic LBA subrange.


AWUN/NAWUN does not have any applicability to write errors caused by power failure or other error
conditions (refer to section 2.1.4.3).


15


NVM Express [®] NVM Command Set Specification, Revision 1.2


The host may indicate that AWUN and NAWUN are not necessary by configuring the Write Atomicity Normal
feature (refer to section 4.1.3.3), which may result in higher performance in some implementations.


**2.1.4.2.1** **AWUN/NAWUN Example (Informative)**


In this example, AWUN/NAWUN has a value of 2KiB (equivalent to four 512-byte logical blocks) and the
namespace atomic boundary sizes (NABSN and NABSPF) are 0h. The host issues two write commands,
each with a length of 2KiB (i.e., four logical blocks). Command A writes LBAs 0-3 and command B writes
LBAs 1-4.


Since the size of both command A and command B is less than or equal to the value of AWUN/NAWUN,
the controller serializes these two write commands so that the resulting data in LBAs 0-4 reflects command
A followed by command B, or command B followed by command A, but not an intermediate state where
some of the logical blocks are written with data from command A and others are written with data from
command B. Figure 5 shows valid results of the data in LBAs 0-4 and examples of invalid results (of which
there are more possible combinations).


**Figure 5: AWUN/NAWUN Example Results**

|Col1|LBA 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Valid Result|A|A|A|A|B||||
|Valid Result|A|B|B|B|B||||
|Invalid Result|A|A|B|B|B||||
|Invalid Result|A|B|A|A|B||||



If the size of write commands A and B is larger than the AWUN/NAWUN value, then there is no guarantee
of ordering. After execution of command A and command B, there may be an arbitrary mix of data from
command A and command B in the LBA range specified.


**2.1.4.3** **AWUPF/NAWUPF**


AWUPF and NAWUPF indicate the behavior of the controller if a power fail or other error condition interrupts
a write operation causing a torn write. A torn write is a write operation where only some of the logical blocks
that are supposed to be written contiguously are actually stored on the NVM, leaving the target logical
blocks in an indeterminate state in which some logical blocks contain original data and some logical blocks
contain new data from the write operation.


If a write command is submitted with size less than or equal to the AWUPF/NAWUPF value and the write
command does not cross an atomic boundary (refer to section 2.1.4.4), the controller guarantees that if the
command fails due to a power failure or other error condition, then subsequent read commands for the
logical blocks associated with the write command shall return one of the following:


  - All old data (i.e., original data on the NVM in the LBA range addressed by the interrupted write); or

  - All new data (i.e., all data to be written to the NVM by the interrupted write).


If a write command is submitted with size greater than the AWUPF/NAWUPF value or crosses an atomic
boundary, then there is no guarantee of the data returned on subsequent reads of the associated logical
blocks.


**2.1.4.3.1** **AWUPF/NAWUPF Example (Informative)**


In this example, AWUPF/NAWUPF has a value of 1KiB (equivalent to two 512-byte logical blocks),
AWUN/NAWUN has a value of 2KiB (equivalent to four 512-byte logical blocks) and the namespace atomic


16


NVM Express [®] NVM Command Set Specification, Revision 1.2


boundary sizes (NABSN and NABSPF) are 0h. Command A writes LBAs 0 to 1. Figure 6 shows the initial
state of the NVM.


**Figure 6: AWUPF/NAWUPF Example Initial State of NVM**

|Col1|LBA 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
||C|B|B|B|B||||



Command A begins executing but is interrupted by a power failure during the writing of the logical block at
LBA 1. Figure 7 describes valid and invalid results.


**Figure 7: AWUPF/NAWUPF Example Final State of NVM**

|Col1|LBA 0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Valid Result|A|A|B|B|B||||
|Valid Result|C|B|B|B|B||||
|Invalid Result|A|B|B|B|B||||
|Invalid Result|C|A|B|B|B||||
|Invalid Result|D|D|B|B|B||||



If the size of write command A is larger than the AWUPF/NAWUPF value, then there is no guarantee of the
state of the data contained in the specified LBA range after the power fail or error condition.


**2.1.4.3.2** **Non-volatile requirements**


After a write command has completed without error, reads for that location which are subsequently
submitted and return data, shall return the data that was written by that write command and not an older
version of the data from previous write commands with the following exception:


If all of the following conditions are met:


a) the controller supports a volatile write cache;
b) the volatile write cache is enabled;
c) the FUA bit for the write is not set;
d) no flush commands, associated with the same namespace as the write, successfully completed

before the controller reports shutdown complete (CSTS.SHST set to 10b); and
e) main power loss occurs on a controller without completing the normal or abrupt shutdown

procedure outlined in the Memory-based Transport Controller Shutdown or Message-based
Transport Controller Shutdown sections in the NVM Express Base Specification,


then subsequent reads for locations written to the volatile write cache that were not written to non-volatile
medium may return older data.


**2.1.4.4** **Atomic Boundaries**


Atomic Boundaries control how the atomicity guarantees defined in section 2.1.4 are enforced by the
controller, with the added constraint of the alignment of the LBA range specified in the command. Atomic
Boundaries are defined on a per namespace basis only. The namespace supports Atomic Boundaries if
NABSN or NABSPF are set to non-zero values.


To ensure backwards compatibility, the values reported for AWUN, AWUPF, and ACWU shall be set such
that they are supported even if a write crosses an atomic boundary. If a controller does not guarantee
atomicity across atomic boundaries, the controller shall set AWUN, AWUPF, and ACWU to 0h (1 LBA).


17


NVM Express [®] NVM Command Set Specification, Revision 1.2


The boundary sizes shall be greater than or equal to the corresponding atomic write sizes:


  - NABSN shall be greater than or equal to AWUN;

  - NABSN shall be greater than or equal to NAWUN if NAWUN is reported;

  - NABSPF shall be greater than or equal to AWUPF; and

  - NABSPF shall be greater than or equal to NAWUPF if NAWUPF is reported.


In addition, NABO shall be less than or equal to NABSN and NABSPF.


For Boundary Offset (NABO) and Boundary Size (NABSN or NABSPF), the LBA range in a command is
within a Namespace Atomic Boundary if none of the logical block addresses in the range cross: Boundary
Offset + (y * Boundary Size); for any integer y ≥ 0.


If a write command crosses the atomic boundary specified by the NABO and NABSN values, then for Single
Atomicity Mode, the atomicity based on the NAWUN value is not guaranteed. If a write command crosses
the atomic boundary specified by the NABO and NABSPF values, then for Single Atomicity Mode, the
atomicity based on the NAWUPF value is not guaranteed. Atomicity guarantees for Multiple Atomicity Mode
are specified in section 2.1.4.5.


Figure 8 shows an example of the behavior of Atomic Boundaries. Writes to an individual blue or yellow
section do not cross an atomic boundary.


**Figure 8: Atomic Boundaries Example**


**2.1.4.5** **Atomic Operation in Multiple Atomicity Mode**


In Multiple Atomicity Mode, controller processing of a write command that crosses any Namespace Atomic
Boundary (e.g., a write command that has a size greater than the AWUN/NAWUN value) results in multiple
atomic write operations.


Figure 9 is an overview of the Multiple Atomicity Mode controller parameters that differ from Single Atomicity
Mode. These parameters may affect command behavior and execution order based on write size (on a per
controller or a per namespace basis).

In Multiple Atomicity Mode, atomicity guarantees for a write command that does not cross a Namespace
Atomic Boundary are the same as Single Atomicity Mode (refer to section 2.1.4.4).


In Multiple Atomicity Mode, controller processing of a write command that crosses any Namespace Atomic
Boundary divides the command-specified range of LBAs into LBA subranges at Namespace Atomic
Boundaries and performs an atomic write operation on each resulting LBA subrange, called an atomic LBA
subrange. The atomicity guarantees apply separately to each atomic LBA subrange. The atomicity value
requirements in Figure 9 ensure that each LBA in the command-specified LBA range is included in an
atomic write operation (i.e., is part of an atomic LBA subrange).


For Multiple Atomicity Mode, atomicity parameter requirements depend on whether the NVM subsystem
reports per namespace values for the atomicity parameters:


a. if per namespace values are reported, then the controller shall set the NABSN field, the NAWUN

field, the NABSPF field, and the NAWUPF field to the same value; and
b. if per namespace values are not reported, then the controller shall set the NABSN field, the AWUN

field, the NABSPF field, and the AWUPF field to the same value.


In Multiple Atomicity Mode, the write operation on each atomic LBA subrange is atomic to the NVM with
respect to other read or write commands. This applies to both normal operating conditions and operation if
a power fail or other error condition interrupts a write operation causing a torn write.


Multiple Atomicity Mode does not affect fused operations (refer to section 2.1.3). All write operations
performed by a command that is part of a fused operation shall be performed in Single Atomicity Mode
(refer to section 2.1.4.1).


**2.1.4.6** **Namespace Atomic Boundaries in Single and Multiple Atomicity Modes**


In Single Atomicity Mode write commands that cross Namespace Atomic Boundaries obtain no atomicity
guarantees. For example, as shown in Figure 10, a single write command D that crosses Namespace
Atomic Boundaries obtains no atomicity guarantees. Three separate write commands (A, B, and C) are
necessary to obtain atomicity guarantees for the LBA subranges between Namespace Atomic Boundaries.


In contrast, in Multiple Atomicity Mode, write command D results in an atomicity guarantee for each LBA
subrange obtained by dividing the LBA range at Namespace Atomic Boundaries (i.e., atomicity guarantees
apply to LBA subranges 0, 1 and 2). In this Multiple Atomicity Mode example, a single write command (D)


19


NVM Express [®] NVM Command Set Specification, Revision 1.2


in obtains atomicity guarantees that require three write commands (A, B and C) to obtain in Single Atomicity
Mode.

**Metadata Region (MR)**



Metadata may be supported for a namespace as part of the logical block (creating an extended logical block
which is a larger logical block that is exposed to the application). Metadata may be transferred as
interleaved with the logical block data (i.e., using the DPTR field) or as a separate buffer of data (i.e., using
the MPTR field). The metadata shall not be split between the logical block data and a separate metadata
buffer. For writes, the metadata shall be written atomically with its associated logical block. Refer to section
5.2.3.


In the case where the namespace is formatted to transfer the metadata as a separate buffer of data, then
the Metadata Region is used. In this case, the location and alignment of the Metadata Region is indicated
by the Metadata Pointer field within the command.


The controller may support several physical formats of logical block data size and associated metadata
size. There may be performance differences between different physical formats. This is indicated as part
of the Identify Namespace data structure.


If the namespace is formatted to use end-to-end data protection (refer to section 5.3), then the last bytes
of the metadata are used for protection information.


**2.2** **I/O Controller Requirements**


**Command Support**


This specification implements the command support requirements for I/O controllers defined in the NVM
Express Base Specification. Additionally, Figure 13 and Figure 14 define NVM Command Set specific
definitions for commands that are mandatory, optional, and prohibited for an I/O controller that supports the
NVM Command Set.
